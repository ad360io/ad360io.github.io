We are developing our products on both Ethereum and NEM, as we believe in taking a blockchain-agnostic approach to offer our users the greatest future flexibility, and to also make sure the survival of our product is more independent of the survival of any individual blockchain. Our advertising application will focus on facilitating branded content, sponsorship, and influencer marketing transactions between advertisers and digital publishers or content creators.</span>

                      <span class ="faq-answer">Our marketplace product is occasionally misconstrued as competing with Google AdSense. Our marketplace product is not focused on general display advertising, but instead prioritizes native advertising: forms of advertising that actively involve content creators and publishers. Branded content is original content created by content publishers in collaboration with advertisers. The content is sometimes about the advertising company or their product, but other times, can just be an entertaining piece of content that advertisers decided to fund to build up goodwill with an audience or define their branding.
                      <br><br>
                      Branded content can range from written posts (e.g. <a href="https://paidpost.nytimes.com/netflix/women-inmates-separate-but-not-equal.html">sponsored posts in The New York Times</a>) to podcasts and videos, to parties or stunts executed in collaboration between a digital publisher and an advertiser. BrandLedger aims to help publishers that are already reliant on native ads — such as Vox, Gizmodo, and The Atlantic — as well as blogs that may wish to host native advertisements but are under-serviced in the current ad environment.
                      <br><br>
                      Influencer marketing consists of paying personalities, celebrities, and other prominent individuals for endorsements. We will focus on targeting Youtube, Twitch, and Snapchat influencer marketing on our platform. Advertisers will be able to easily toggle the kind of advertising they are looking to purchase on the marketplace.</span>

The tokens are a critical component of product functionality and are the resources used to participate in BrandLedger application services. In the marketplace, tokens are transferred from advertiser to content creator, e.g. an advertiser purchases pieces of branded content on a content creator's blog. In future updates to our product, our tokens will have staking functionality to incentivize users exceeding token ownership thresholds to host backup nodes of our marketplace. We are also considering incentivizing users to serve as oracles who host software that validate sales, signups, or other actions when we roll out our blockchain-mediated and fingerprinting-free cost-per-sale, cost-per-signup, or cost-per-action transactions to benefit Content Creators in the future.</span>

                  <div class="card-body">
                    <span class ="faq-answer">Ethereum and NEM are the two most promising blockchain technologies right now, and we want to make sure that if a user desires flexibility, we are offering it to them. We are putting consumers first and give them a choice about which one they want to use. After all, when was the last time a user complaining about a product providing them greater freedom and flexibility?
                    <br><br>
                    Our goal is to build a great, flexible product with options for our users, and it is for that reason that we are motivated to develop on both blockchains. We see user interest in investing in the project and developing the technology from both Ethereum and NEM, and believe that the positives of giving consumers more choice and flexibility is worth the added development cost.
                    <br><br>
                    Both Ethereum and NEM right now are highly promising and thriving technologies. Both blockchains have seen huge growth and interest, and evidence suggests that supporting both will enhance the success of the BrandLedger ecosystem as a whole. Ultimately, we are interested in building a product that provides the BrandLedger functionality on a user's preferred blockchain technology. This is the case whether one chooses to use Ethereum, NEM, or both.
                    <br><br>
                    We believe strongly in both Ethereum and NEM, and simply picking one over the other not only strips flexibility from users, but also artificially limits the future potential of BrandLedger. Why only develop on NEM or Ethereum when both are available and exciting technologies?
                    <br><br>
                    We are confident in their potential and both are capable of secure and decentralized transactions with future scalability. There certainly is no shortage of momentum or interest in blockchain advertising within both the NEM and Ethereum communities. It is very likely that both Ethereum and NEM will coexist in the future.</span>

                    <span class ="faq-answer">Ethereum and NEM both have unique selling points, and both can be integrated into BrandLedger to produce something that may not otherwise be possible.
                    <br><br>
                    NEM has a security and scalability advantage over Ethereum, and in many ways is better oriented for enterprise from the ground up in its design. On the other hand, Ethereum has more adoption at this point and more public exposure. Coding smart contracts is also more straightforward in Ethereum (which comes at the cost of security). In terms of coding, NEM has the advantage in that no new language learning is required, whereas Ethereum requires using Solidity (which is similar to Javascript).
                    <br><br>
                    We see NEM as a fantastic fit for a decentralized advertising platform. Features like the NIS/NCC and PoI architecture of NEM were a huge consideration for us in choosing NEM as one of the two blockchains for BrandLedger's initial development and launch. We see the advantages of NEM in terms of security and scalability, and are looking forward to broadening NEM exposure.
                    <br><br>
                    Speaking more to Ethereum, initial advertisers incorporating BrandLedger into their marketing strategy won't do so blindly — the ones that do will be ones that are already deeply aware of blockchain technology. Many of these advertisers are invested in the Ethereum ecosystem, are already using other Ethereum dapps, and like the model of smart contracts being stored on all blockchain nodes. In the short term they will most likely prefer to use BrandLedger with Ethereum. We believe that these blockchain enthusiast advertisers will pave the way for more mainstream advertisers to use our product.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, mainstream media attention is driving interest toward Ethereum first, and people in media and advertising are paying attention. The advertising industry is relatively averse to breaking with tradition. We see Ethereum as a starting point for these ad industry stalwarts — a gateway to get them invested in working with blockchain technology, which it is our goal to promote.
                    <br><br>
                    An app that supports both blockchains can bring people using Ethereum to NEM. NEM is a great technology, but it currently has a bit less exposure in the US. This is sure to change in the future, and BrandLedger can be a part of that process.
                    <br><br>
                    In the end, we believe that there are technical merits to both technologies. As blockchain enthusiasts, we genuinely wish for mutual success.</span>
